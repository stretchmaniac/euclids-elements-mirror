Compass and Straight Edge Construction
===

Goals
---

- Create user interface so that compass/straight edge construction is intuitive and fun
- Allow creation of user-defined macros so that repeated constructions can be packaged into a single command
- Gamify? (might make a fun game)

Notes
---
- Look at JavaFX / FXML for GUI and drawing. It appears far more convenient than Java Swing.
